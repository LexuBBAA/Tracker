Tracker is an Android App developed to be used as a tool at the workplace. 

One of my former colleagues has asked me for advice regarding an Android app that should track the time spent by one at work. As I have told her that I will personally look into the matter, I have started working on this app.

Tracker is currently at version 1.0.0, enabling its users to track time spent on tasks / at work. It uses an SQLite Database for data storing, and has been developed entirely by me.

The app enables the user to record his working times, handling all the events such as Starting, Pausing, Resuming, Stopping the tracking times. In addition to this, the user can later edit the recorded times by setting a title and a description, although the app does not require any of them for the expected functionality.

Since the app is currently at v1.0.0, it might not seem to provide many features, but it is just a prototype at the moment. Later versions are expected to support Push Notifications, and alarms.
